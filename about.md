## About

I'm trying to create some softwares that are useful for other people or just myself.

## Projects

Checkout at [Pubs of ibigbug®](https://pub.ibigbug.online)

## Experiences

I've become a software developer(or engineer) for 5 years.

I can write web/desktop sotware in different programming languages.

I used to be a fan of HTTP/Linux/Distributed System/HA and I'm using Windows as my production environment now.

I used to hate Java and XML and I still find YAML sucks.
